*Learnings*

This project was very comprehensinve in working with multiple react components and a good experience building from scratch. I was able to plan out the overall structure and slowly and steadily implement componenets. Some of the tricky parts were setting up the correct routes, deciding where state should live, and creating a compact NavBar that can be placed on any page. 

I also learned the value of default values and how they can often be a simple solution to the applicaiton failing to render in addition to using UseEffect and cleanup functions to keep the app working properly.

Moreover, <span> is a useful component for keeping CSS consisent as well as keeping headers with strings and template literals inline.
